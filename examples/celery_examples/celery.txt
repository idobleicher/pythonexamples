Celery: Distributed Task Queue

Celery is an asynchronous task queue/job queue based on distributed message passing.

It is focused on real-time operation, but supports scheduling as well.

The execution units, called tasks, are executed concurrently on a single or more worker servers using multiprocessing,
 Eventlet,	or gevent.
  Tasks can execute asynchronously (in the background)  or synchronously (wait until ready).



Running rabbit: sudo apt-get install rabbitmq-server
on docker:$ docker run -d -p 5462:5462 rabbitmq

Celery is on the Python Package Index (PyPI), so it can be installed with standard Python tools like pip or easy_install:
$ pip install celery


Running the Celery worker server
You can now run the worker by executing our program with the worker argument:

tasks - the python code
$ celery -A tasks worker --loglevel=info

celery worker --help

celery help

run:
/projects/personal/pythonexamples/examples/celery/example1$ celery -A tasks worker --loglevel=info
#In production you’ll want to run the worker in the background as a daemon. To do this you need to use the tools provided by your platform,


~/projects/personal/pythonexamples/examples$ celery -A celery_examples.celery_example_1.celeryapp1 worker --loglevel=debug
