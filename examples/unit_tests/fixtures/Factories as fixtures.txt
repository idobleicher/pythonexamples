Factories as fixtures
The “factory as fixture” pattern can help in situations where the result of a fixture is needed multiple times in a single test. Instead of returning data directly, the fixture instead returns a function which generates the data. This function can then be called multiple times in the test.

Factories can have have parameters as needed:

@pytest.fixture
def make_customer_record():

    def _make_customer_record(name):
        return {
            "name": name,
            "orders": []
        }

    return _make_customer_record


def test_customer_records(make_customer_record):
    customer_1 = make_customer_record("Lisa")
    customer_2 = make_customer_record("Mike")
    customer_3 = make_customer_record("Meredith")
If the data created by the factory requires managing, the fixture can take care of that:

@pytest.fixture
def make_customer_record():

    created_records = []

    def _make_customer_record(name):
        record = models.Customer(name=name, orders=[])
        created_records.append(record)
        return record

    yield _make_customer_record

    for record in created_records:
        record.destroy()


def test_customer_records(make_customer_record):
    customer_1 = make_customer_record("Lisa")
    customer_2 = make_customer_record("Mike")
    customer_3 = make_customer_record("Meredith")
