If during implementing your tests you realize that you want to use a fixture function from multiple test files
you can move it to a conftest.py file.

 You don’t need to import the fixture you want to use in a test, it automatically gets discovered by pytest.

 The discovery of fixture functions starts at test classes, then test modules, then conftest.py files
  and finally builtin and third party plugins.

You can also use the conftest.py file to implement local per-directory plugins.
